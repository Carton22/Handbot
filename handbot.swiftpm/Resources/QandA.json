    "prompt": "Please explain quantum computing in simple terms.",
    "id": 0,
    "answer": "Quantum computing is a new type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than traditional computers. In classical computing, information is stored and processed in bits, which are either 0 or 1. However, in quantum computing, information is stored in quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously, which makes them much faster than classical computers for certain types of problems, such as factoring large numbers or simulating complex systems. Quantum computing is a rapidly developing field, with many potential applications in areas such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization."

    "prompt": "What are the benefits of exercise?",
    "id": 1,
    "answer": "Improves cardiovascular health: Exercise strengthens the heart and lungs, improving their ability to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues. Increases muscle strength and endurance: Exercise can help build and maintain strong muscles, which are essential for activities of daily living. Promotes weight loss: Regular exercise can help you lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight. Reduces the risk of chronic diseases: Exercise has been shown to lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer."

    "prompt": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
    "id": 2,
    "answer": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a warming effect on the planet."

    "id": 4,
    "answer": "COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe and can appear anywhere from 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone who contracts COVID-19 will experience all of these symptoms, and some people may not have any symptoms at all. However, it's important to note that even people who are asymptomatic can still transmit the virus to others. "

    "prompt": "What is the boiling point of water?",
    "id": 5,
    "answer": "The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level. However, the boiling point can vary depending on the atmospheric pressure and altitude. At higher elevations, where atmospheric pressure is lower, the boiling point of water is lower than 100 degrees Celsius."
